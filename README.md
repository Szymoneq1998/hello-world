# hello-world

Hi People!
Im from Poland and study programming for myself. Now I am learning CSS language to make my HTML projects colorful and good to read. I know it is difficult but i really want to work in company like Apple or Google, because I want to make innovative things and new apps.
Good to be on GitHub.
